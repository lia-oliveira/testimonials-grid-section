## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
1 - One of the most important lessons I learned from this project was working with measurements based on multiples of 10. I had used this technique before, but I believe I now truly understand how much easier it makes things. It involves setting the HTML font size to a percentage equivalent to ten pixels. From there, 10px = 1rem, so to apply, for example, 13px, you just use 1.3rem. After that, the work flowed much faster, and the results were more precise.

```css
html {
    font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

2 -I learned how to change the color of .svg via CSS.
```css

.card-header__icon[data-icon="quotation"] {
    ...
    fill: var(--co-primary-03-light-pink-70);
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

I need to learn more about shadows and how to name classes using BEM. I think I not only need to work on more projects or watch more tutorials but also to see other people's solutions.

### Useful resources

The main resources I used were:


- [Origamid's Complete CSS Grid Guide](https://www.origamid.com/projetos/css-grid-layout-guia-completo/) - It helps me recall property names and their purposes. It's an excellent quick-reference guide.
- [Origamid's Complete CSS Flexbox Guide](https://origamid.com/projetos/flexbox-guia-completo/) - For the same reasons I chose the CSS Grid guide.
- [Cesar Lopesâ€™ blog post on "How to Change SVG Color with CSS"](https://www.cesarlopes.com/site/como-alterar-a-cor-de-um-svg-com-css/) - I learned how to change SVG colors via CSS.
- [CSS Tricksâ€™ Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Also great for quick references and solving specific CSS Grid doubts.
- [CSS Grid Layout da Mozila](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout) - Iâ€™m reading it to improve my understanding of Grid and to do better in future projects.
